# Last Watch AI - REST API

Last Watch is an API-first application. Anything that is managed with the web interface can also be managed with the web API as documented here.

This documentation might not be completely up to date. You can always reverse engineer the API by using the inspector on your browser to see what the web inteface is doing. Also, you can refer to the [API Routes](https://github.com/akmolina28/last-watch-ai/blob/master/src/routes/api.php) to see how the API is defined in the code.
